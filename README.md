## Work Experience

### AES Ohio *(Dayton, OH)*
**T&D Project Planning Engineer Summer Intern** *(May 2024 - July 2024)*
- Developed an interactive cost-estimating tool using Excel and VBA by mining the company’s historical supply-chain data and contracts from SAP, which eliminated the need for contracting firms and freed up budget for more critical tasks
- Created a preliminary scope, estimate, and schedule for an incoming $500M CapEx customer project, with the results used to sign the Memorandum of Understanding and the Customer Service Agreement
- Developed a KPI for capital projects prioritization to forecast investments’ impacts on customer rates, enabling executive decision-making on incoming projects

### AES Ohio *(Dayton, OH)*
**T&D Project Planning Engineer Spring Intern** *(January 2024 - May 2024)*
- Created lists for long-lead materials for existing and upcoming projects, enabling supply chain to reserve manufacturing slots
- Audited engineering documents for 345kV transmission line poles to extract structure weights and identify causes for procurement and construction price gaps that were nearly three times industry averages, to ultimately find that 
- Prepared development-to-execution project meeting presentations, ensuring details such as scope, schedule, and cost estimates were accurately reflected

### University of Dayton *(Dayton, OH)*
**Teaching Assistant** *(October 2023 - December 2023)*
- Led a total of three sections- one Calculus-based and two Algebra-based General Physics 1 courses
- Graded an average of 200 quizzes and homework assignments weekly to meet turnaround deadlines
- Conducted group office hours twice a week to assist students with homework questions and exam preparation

### University of Dayton *(Dayton, OH)*
**Undergraduate Research Assistant** *(May 2023 - August 2023)*
- Researched how an atom’s interactions with its field are a cause of quantum-behavior suppression at macroscopic scales
- Applied research to Young’s Double Slit experiment by mathematically modeling an electromagnetic field that induces quantum suppression. Discovered that an atom’s interaction with its field is strongly related with its field-coupling strength
- Programmed a Python tool to numerically solve second- and third-order differential equations and animate solution graphs
- Compiled research findings in a presentation to communicate technical information to audiences from diverse backgrounds
